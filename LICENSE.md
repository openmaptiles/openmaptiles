The vector tile schema has been developed by Klokan Technologies GmbH and
was initially modelled after the cartography of the CARTO's Positron basemap
with permission from CartoDB Inc.
The vector tile schema has been refined and improved in cooperation with
the Wikimedia Foundation and is heavily influenced by years of
Paul Norman's experience of creating maps from OpenStreetMap data.

Products or services using maps derived from OpenMapTiles schema need to visibly
credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to
http://openmaptiles.org/.

For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the
credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[© OpenMapTiles](http://openmaptiles.org/) [© OpenStreetMap contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual
description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.
