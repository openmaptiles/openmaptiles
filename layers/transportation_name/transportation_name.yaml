      This is the layer for labelling the highways. Only highways that are named `name=*` and are long enough
      to place text upon appear. The OSM roads are stitched together if they contain the same name
      to have better label placement than having many small linestrings.
      For motorways you should use the `ref` field to label them while for other roads you should use `name`.

  fields:
    name: The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highways#Names_and_references) value of the highway.
    name_en: English name `name:en` if available, otherwise `name`. This is deprecated and will be removed in a future release in favor of `name:en`.
    name_de: German name `name:de` if available, otherwise `name` or `name:en`. This is deprecated and will be removed in a future release in favor of `name:de`.
    ref: The OSM [`ref`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:ref) tag of the motorway or its network.
    ref_length: Length of the `ref` field. Useful for having a shield icon as background for labeling motorways.
    network:
      description: |
          The network type derived mainly from [`network`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:network) tag of the road.
