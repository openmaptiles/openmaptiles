  id: "housename"
  description: |
      Everything in OpenStreetMap which contains a `addr:housename` tag useful for labelling housenames on a map.
      This adds significant size to *z14*. For buildings the centroid of the building is used as housename.
      Duplicates within a tile are dropped if they have the same street/block_name (records without name tag are prioritized for preservation).
